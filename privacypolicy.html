                    <li>
                        Telegram has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                They don't use your data to show you ads.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They only store the data that Telegram needs to function as a secure and feature-rich messaging service.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>
                    About the bot. In any of the above cases, the developers of an automated user (bot) can get your public account data (section 3.1 of Telegram’s privacy policy): your screen name, username and profile picture(s).
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Bots can also receive the following data when you interact with them.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If you click on links or buttons provided by the bot, the bot can potentially get your IP address (provided that it controls the website to which the link leads).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If the bot is a member of the same group with you, it may know you are a member.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        When you start your message with the username of an inline bot (e.g. @gif) the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot. This query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service. We will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Bots added to groups can operate in two modes: with access to messages in the group or without access. If the bot has access to messages, it can see everything that happens in the group. The interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups.
                                    </li>

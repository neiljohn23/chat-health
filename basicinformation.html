                        <h5><b>Transmission and origins of the virus</b></h5>
                        <p>Researchers believe that <span class="orange">SARS-CoV-2</span> originated in bats; within bats, the virus can <i>replicate without getting it sick, and it can pass it on to other animals</i> that will eventually pass it on to humans. This is what occurred in <span data-tooltip="Wuhan is a popular area in China, meaning that there is a lot of human-human contact within that confined region." class="deep_pink">Wuhan, China, </span>  which is where scientists believe the first human was infected. The virus then passed from person-to-person through heavy droplets from people coughing and sneezing. The virus can survive for up to <span class="deeporange">three hours</span> in the air, up to <span class="orange">four hours</span> on copper, up to <span class="deep_pink">24 hours</span> on cardboard, and up to <span class="deeporange">two-three days</span> on both plastic and stainless steel, <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/new-coronavirus-stable-hours-surfaces" style="color:black">according to the NIH.</a></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="right">
                        <p>Upon entering your body, a virus particle will use <span class="deep_pink">proteins</span> on its surface to enter our cells. These proteins can pass through the cell’s membrane by pairing with specific <span class="orange">ACE 2-receptors</span> in our lungs. After the virus gets inside, it can release its RNA <span class="deeporange">- its genetic material -</span> telling your cell to make multiple copies of the viral genetic information. Your cells unknowingly become like little factories for producing viral molecules. While the virus is still replicating, you won’t experience any symptoms - that’s why it’s called the <span class="deep_pink">incubation period.</span> The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be <b>4 days.</b> This means that you might be infected and still not show any outward symptoms.

                        <h5><i>Symptoms</i></h5>
                        <p>The most common symptoms that we’re seeing are <span class="orange">fever, sore throat, cough, and shortness of breath.</span> It’s important to note that you do not need to have all of these symptoms at the same time in order to have COVID-19. If you don’t have a fever, <i>that doesn’t mean that you don’t have the virus</i> - you may simply develop it at a different time during the infection. Roughly <span class="deeporange">3-5% of people</span> will experience vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. If you develop mild symptoms, <span class="deep_pink">stay home and try not to panic.</span> Call your doctor instead of sitting and waiting in a waiting room where you could potentially spread or acquire the disease. <b>Your doctor will be able to provide you with the best course of action based on your symptoms. </b></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="right">
                        <p>If you live with others and suspect that you have COVID-19, then designate a <span class="orange">sick room or sick area</span> if possible to prevent exposure of others to the virus. If possible, <span class="deep_pink">use your own utensils and dishes.</span> If you have access to a facemask and it does not inhibit your breathing, wear one to try and <span class="deeporange">prevent the spread to others.</span> Make sure to monitor your symptoms and call your doctor immediately if things get worse. If your fever has increased and/or you have persistent chest pain, blue-ish lips, confusion, or severe shortness of breath, consider calling your <span class="orange">local emergency department</span> to inform them of your symptoms. They will advise you on what you should do.

                        <p>For the majority of people, <span class="deep_pink">recovery at home is an option.</span> But, for others, they may develop more severe symptoms. Patients may develop <span class="deeporange">Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).</span> This is a syndrome where your lungs become severely inflamed, making it far more difficult to get oxygen through your lungs and into your cells. Because ARDS can manifest in several different illnesses, such as pneumonia or sepsis, <span class="orange">ICU’s are often equipped with equipment that can help you get oxygen.</span></p>

                        <p>Everyone is at risk of getting COVID-19, but those more at-risk are the <span class="deeporange">elderly and people with underlying health conditions.</span> In China, roughly 78% of cases were people who are 30-69 years old, and 20% within that group developed severe symptoms. In the US, <i>8 out of 10 people who have died from the illness are over the age of 65.</i> Even with these risk factors, <span class="deep_pink">we can’t predict who will develop severe symptoms,</span> which is why it’s so important that we all work together to do our part and <b>self-isolate.</b>

                        <p>Our goal is to <span class="deeporange">slow the spread of the virus</span> so that health care systems around the world don’t become overwhelmed. This allows researchers to have more time to produce an effective vaccine for the virus. Let’s say everyone wanted to get hand sanitizer at the same time. What happens is that <span class="deep_pink">everyone will try and get their hands on hand sanitizer,</span> and some will not be able to get any <span class="orange">even if they need it.</span> The same logic can be applied to our hospital beds and ventilators - if we’re able to slow the spread of the virus, <i>we have a chance at making sure our hospital systems don’t get overwhelmed</i> and people who need ventilators will have access to them.</p>

                        <p><i>“If we’ll all just get the virus at some point, why do social distancing efforts matter?”</i> Let’s look at history. During the time of the Spanish Flu, Philadelphia took two weeks to implement extreme social distancing measures. As a result, their <span class="deeporange">fatality count spiked.</span> St. Louis, in contrast, implemented their social distancing measures <span class="orange">immediately</span> and had comparatively fewer fatalities - <span class="deep_pink">producing a flatter curve.</span> We want to be like St. Louis, and there are two things that you can do right now to make sure we achieve that.</p>
